Status of FemtoEmacs Key Bindings
=================================

Key [E] Implemented in Editor and bound to key
    [I] Interface to Femtolisp completed
    [*] We should implement next

This listing to be used as the guide to the names of the functions that will be added
in order to maintain compatibility with GNU Emacs as close as possible.
The closer we follow the GNU Emacs reference implementation the easier it will be for
others to write extensions and to use FemtoEmacs.
